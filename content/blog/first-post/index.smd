Enough about Zine, let's talk about zines.

## Fanzines

A zine (short for *fanzine*, from "fan" + "magazine") is a non-professional
publication created by people that want to express themselves in paper form,
usually in relation to a cultural phenomenon of some kind.

[An example of zine from 1976.](<$image.asset("fanzine.jpg").alt("A photo of a black and white flyer. The main title reads 'A night of pure energy' and the rest of the page contains a mix of pictures of guitarists interleaved with other text snippets, some seemingly taken from a professional publication of some kind, and some handwritten to announce concert night dates, presumably for the musicians in the picture.")>)

## Zines in the digital era

In the digital era lmao

## We're not in 1990 anymore

Despite

**The goal is to make art**: the act of inducing a change in others through
our self-expression.

You could argue that the 90's excelled at self-expression, but in doing so you
would also have to accept that social media is infinitely more effective at
inducing change in others (albeit at the expense of freedom of expression).

Once you realize that, the path forward is clear:

1. Own your content.
2. Create new social systems that optimize for creating art over engagement.

Owning

With that in mind, **go make art with your portfolio of investment**.
